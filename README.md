# Image-processing-based-automatic-cargo-handler-robot
In this project, we have developed a prototype of automated cargo handler robot. This robot can identify a cargo by its color and shape by continuously taking pictures in front and processing the image to identify the desired object. Not only identifying the cargo but also it approaches towards it, picks it up when itâ€™s in range and find the drop zone completely by image processing techniques

#Details can be found in the formal_report.pdf
